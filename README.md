## 🚀 Project Overview

Choosing the right career path is often confusing due to a lack of clarity, guidance, and reliable information. Career Compass aims to solve this problem by acting as a digital career counselor that helps users:

- Discover suitable career paths based on interests and skills  
- Understand required skills and learning paths  
- Explore career growth, opportunities, and trends  
- Plan actionable steps toward their career goals  

This project focuses on clarity, simplicity, and structured guidance rather than overwhelming users with generic advice.
